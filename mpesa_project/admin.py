# This file is intentionally empty - admin configuration is handled in mpesa_app/admin.py
# However, the following customization can be uncommented to customize the admin site header:

# from django.contrib import admin
#
# admin.site.site_header = "M-Pesa Payment Administration"
# admin.site.site_title = "M-Pesa Admin"
# admin.site.index_title = "Welcome to M-Pesa Transaction Management"
